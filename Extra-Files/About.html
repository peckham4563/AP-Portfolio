                        My name is Alexander Cash Peckham and I am a current student in a program at the University of Texas of Austin. I am 22 years old and was born, raised, and currently living in Houston, Texas. My personal interests include working with technology, hardware and software, mechanics and engineering, and I love working with animals as well!

                    <p>
                        I am currently enrolled in the UT of Austin Coding Bootcamp. In my past, I was enrolled at the University of Houston from 2018 to 2022, as part of the Mechanical Engineering of Technology school. I completed up to an Associate's Degree from U of H before becoming extremely interested in coding and enrolling in a 6 month long course offered from the Univeristy of Texas to pursue my newfound interest.

                    <p>
                        For my professional work experience, I've worked since I was 18 years old at different establishments in Houston, including a Sales Associate at <a href="https://www.academy.com/">Academy Sports & Outdoors</a>, and a Barista at <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks Coffee Co.</a> Each work experience has taught me a different set of skills that have tremendously aided me in my pursuit of education, future work endeavors, and daily day-to-day life. Some of the skills include the ability to ensure customer satisfaction, time management and organization, and leadership experience. 
                    </p>
                    <p>However, I belive that having to adapt a more extroverted presence and learning  how to work well within a team are the most important skills I've learned so far.üòÅ
